    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices 1/2"-thick Pullman or other white bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 ounces thinly slices American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato soup <em>(optional)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Place bread on a cutting board and spread mayonnaise over top side of each; this is key to a golden, delectable crunch. </li> 
       <li>Heat a small skillet (nonstick, ideally) over medium. Slide in half of butter. When it melts, place 1 slice of bread, mayonnaise side down, in skillet; top with cheese; season with pepper. </li>
       <li>Top with second slice of bread, mayonnaise side up. When underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes, turn sandwich and add remaining butter to skillet. Press down on sandwich to encourage even browning and to help melt cheese—be gentle, don’t smash it.</li>
       <li>Cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted. Eat immediately, preferably with soup.</li>
    </ol>
